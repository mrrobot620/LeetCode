    "### The big O complexity , this is defined by the number of operations done to solve a problem . Also in this , only the worst case secanrio is taken in account\n",
    "\n",
    "- **O(1)** => This is the constant time , and this is always the best optimised solution for every problem if it can be done.\n",
    "- **O(logn)** => This is the second most optimized way of solving a problem , where less no of operations are performed to solve a problem . The best example for this is ```Binary Search```\n",
    "- **O(n)** => This involves doing the thing n number of operations where n of items are present in the problem .Example . A for or while loop . ```for item in items: print(item) ```\n",
    "- **O(n^2)** => This is one of the worst time complexity  . Example a nested for loop ``` for i in range(n): for j in range(n): print(i,j)```\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to note is that in Big O nation we tend to drop the constant , Also we use the dominant number of operations . For example if there are 2 nested loop and one 1 simple loop ( The constant should be like **O(n^2 + n)** but be drop the n cause it has signifant less number of operations then the first only and we only use  **O(n^2)**\n",
